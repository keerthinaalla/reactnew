/*Main Points*/
1.we can inject React into our app by using CDN links and through npm
2.after creating if you want to create any tag with in the root div, we have to use React.creatElement()
React.createElement("h1",{},"heading1") method contains tagName, tag attributes,content of the tag 
syntax:
const heading1=React.createElement("h1",{class:"heading1"},"heading1")
output for this:<h1 class="heading1">heading1</h1> in the browser
what is heading1?
when we see console.log(heading1);--->output:a javascript Object
finally React.createElement is an Object
the best part of the react is, we can use React already excisting application and we can use small portion of the application
like only in footer,header, small portion of div also by using the CDN links.
